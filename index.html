	<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
	<p>A little bit about myself. My name is Karan. Currently 25 years old. I've been bouldering on and off for around the past 3 years. First time climbing was at Brooklyn Boulders in Brooklyn. Ever since then, I have fallen in love with the actitvity. This page is here to show people a little bit about bouldering and a small glimpse of what a normal day of climbing indoors is like, at least for me :D</p>

	<h2>What is bouldering?</h2>
	<p>Bouldering is a variation of climbing which involves climbing routes that are relatively low to the ground (anywhere from 8 to 20 feet up high), without the use of any harnesses or rope. Bouldering routes are typically short, and are comprised of a few powerful moves, versus other traditional ways of climbing in which stamina and endurance also come into play. Routes for bouldering, in the U.S., are graded on a VB scale. Indoor grades range from v0 to v10 (or v11 depending on location and people setting the routes indoors.) Outdoor grades range from v0 all the way to v16.</p>

	<h3>What are the essentials for bouldering?</h3>
	<p>The great thing about bouldering is that you don't really need a lot of equipment to get started! You will <strong>need</strong> the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A pair of climbing shoes</li>
		<li>Chalk</li>
		<li>Clothes you feel comfortable moving around in</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Unfortunately, living in NYC means there are only a few places to actual boulder. Although you definitely need what was listed above to climb, you <em>may</em> also need the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A membership to an indoor climbing gym</li>
		<li>A crash pad</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A gym membership isn't necessary, but due to the lack of outdoor climbing areas and changing seasons, climbing consistently gets to be a challenge. With indoor climbing gyms, you get the oppurtunity to have access to climbing walls all year long. The crash pad is needed if you plan on doing some bouldering outdoors. There are areas within Cental Park that have wonderful boulders to climb, but a pad is needed for you to land safely on.</p>

	<h4>My climbing sessions</h4>
	<p>I have a membership to Brooklyn Boulders Queensbridge, and tend to climb at the gym roughly three times a week. I stick to bouldering for the majority of my time spent there, but do some light weight training in the provided weights section prior to climbing. Depending on the day, it'll either be focusing on chest, back or legs. I would consider myself on an intermediate level of bouldering. I tend to work my way up to problems that are graded around the v6/v7 range. The following table lists the number of routes I climb for that grade during a normal climbing session. For the higher graded routes, I will have count it as long as I got two or three moves of the route completed (for the purpose of this table). This will vary from day to day depending on how my body is feeling on that day.</p>
