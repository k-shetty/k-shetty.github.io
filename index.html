	<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
	<p>A little bit about myself. My name is Karan. Currently 25 years old. I've been bouldering on and off for around the past 3 years. First time climbing was at Brooklyn Boulders in Brooklyn. Ever since then, I have fallen in love with the actitvity. This page is here to show people a little bit about bouldering and a small glimpse of what a normal day of climbing indoors is like, at least for me :D</p>
