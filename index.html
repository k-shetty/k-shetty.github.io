	<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
	<p>A little bit about myself. My name is Karan. Currently 25 years old. I've been bouldering on and off for around the past 3 years. First time climbing was at Brooklyn Boulders in Brooklyn. Ever since then, I have fallen in love with the actitvity. This page is here to show people a little bit about bouldering and a small glimpse of what a normal day of climbing indoors is like, at least for me :D</p>

	<h2>What is bouldering?</h2>
	<p>Bouldering is a variation of climbing which involves climbing routes that are relatively low to the ground (anywhere from 8 to 20 feet up high), without the use of any harnesses or rope. Bouldering routes are typically short, and are comprised of a few powerful moves, versus other traditional ways of climbing in which stamina and endurance also come into play.</p>

	<h3>What are the essentials for bouldering?</h3>
	<p>The great thing about bouldering is that you don't really need a lot of equipment to get started! You will <strong>need</strong> the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A pair of climbing shoes</li>
		<li>Chalk</li>
		<li>Clothes you feel comfortable moving around in</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Unfortunately, living in NYC means there are only a few places to actual boulder. Although you definitely need what was listed above to climb, you <em>may</em> also need the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A membership to an indoor climbing gym</li>
		<li>A crash pad</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A gym membership isn't necessary, but due to the lack of outdoor climbing areas and changing seasons, climbing consistently gets to be a challenge. With indoor climbing gyms, you get the oppurtunity to have access to climbing walls all year long. The crash pad is needed if you plan on doing some bouldering outdoors. There are areas within Cental Park that have wonderful boulders to climb, but a pad is needed for you to land safely on.</p>

	<h4>My climbing sessions</h4>
	<p>I have a membership to Brooklyn Boulder Queensbridge, and tend to climb at the gym roughly three times a week. I stick to bouldering for the majority of my time spent there, but do some light weight training in the provided weights section prior to climbing. </p>
