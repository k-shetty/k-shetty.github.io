	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>A little bit about myself. My name is Karan. I'm a male, currently 25 years old, living in NYC. I've been bouldering on and off for around the past 3 years. I was introduced to this activity by a close friend of mine who wanted to be more active and do so being outdoors. He had decided he wanted to try climbing and offered me to come with him to try it. My first time climbing was at Brooklyn Boulders in Brooklyn.  Ever since then, I have fallen in love with the actitvity. This page is here to show people a little bit about bouldering and a small glimpse of what a normal day of climbing indoors is like, at least for me :D</p>
